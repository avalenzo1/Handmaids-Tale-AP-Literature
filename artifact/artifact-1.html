<p>
  For the future Handmaid:<br>
  Don't let the Commanders abuse you<br>
  Don't let the Wives <br>
  Don’t let the Angels<br>
  Don’t let the Eyes frighten you<br>
  Don’t let the Guardians<br>
  Don't let the Aunts patronize you;<br>
  Don't let the Marthas <br>

  They all want to dehumanize your existence,<br>
  You are more than what they say.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Don't let those bastards grind you down.
</p>
