  "Nolite Bastardes Carborundorum"
  For the future Handmaid:
  Don't let the Commanders abuse you;
  He is wicked, and filled with ego.
  Don't let the Wives patronize you;
  You shan't take their words to heart.
  Don’t let the Angels frighten you;
  Don’t let the Eyes frighten you;
  They only seek to blind the eyes of the enlightened.
  Don’t let the Guardians deceive you;
  They abuse power thence confided.
  Don't let the Aunts indoctrinate you;
  As they are false prophets.
  Don't let the Marthas


  They all want to dehumanize your existence,
  And the point is to keep your resistance.
  You are more than what they say,
  You are not Of anything but yourself,
  You are not an object, forced to have a baby,
  You are a human—a woman.

  Don't let those bastards grind you down.
